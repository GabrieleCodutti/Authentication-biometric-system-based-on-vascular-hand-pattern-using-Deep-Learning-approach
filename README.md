# Authentication-biometric-system-based-on-vascular-hand-pattern-using-Deep-Learning-approach
A biometric authentication system composed of a client that capture images at different wavelenght and of a server that elaborate this images and make the prevision.
It uses a Transfer Learning approach based on AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network and the communication between client and server is based on WebSocket through the SocketIO Python library.
Furthermore, the communication is encrypted by using an AES with the session key encrypted with an asymmetric encryption RSA.
The GUI (Graphical User Interface) has been realized with Tkinter Python library:

An image that enters in the model is visualized like this:
