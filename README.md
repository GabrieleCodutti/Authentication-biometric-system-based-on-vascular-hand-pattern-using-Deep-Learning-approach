# Authentication-biometric-system-vascular-hand-pattern-basend-on-Deep-Learning-approach
A biometric authentication system composed of a client that capture image at different wavelenght and of a server that elaborate the image and make the prevision.
It uses a Transfer Learning approach based on AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network and the communication between client and server is based on WebSocket thanks to SocketIO Python library.
Furthermore, the communication is encrypted by using an AES with the session key encrypted with an asymmetric encryption RSA.
The GUI (Graphical User Interface) has been realized with Tkinter Python library:
